# ▶️ Getting Started

## What is Chub AI?

Chub is platform that allows you to interact with characters through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Models (LLMs). These models are accessed through the use of APIs which Chub streamlines into a convenient to use chatbot service.

Chub is **uncensored**. We do not restrict in any meaningful capacity the variety of characters that are allowed to be posted on the platform nor the type of interactions you are allowed to have with said characters.

Chub AI supports numerous APIs such as OpenAI or Anthropic (Claude), features such as chat trees, exporting/importing chats from existing services, and much more!

## Registering an Account

Registering for a Chub account is simple and only takes a few minutes.

1. Go to [venus.chub.ai](https://venus.chub.ai/) and click "Register" in the top right corner.
2. Enter your email address. This will be used sparingly, only for password recovery and our [subscription service](https://venus.chub.ai/mars).
3. Choose a unique username. Your username is public and used to represent you throughout Chub Venus.
4. Create a strong, secure password. We encourage you to use a password manager to generate a random, unique password.
5. Your account is now registered and set up. You can log in using the credentials you created.

That's all there is to it. Once logged in, you'll be able to create your first character and start interacting right away.&#x20;

Please note that by using Chub Venus AI's services, you are agreeing to our [Terms of Service](https://www.chub.ai/tos) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.chub.ai/privacy). Failure to follow these guidelines may result in account restrictions or termination.
