# üèóÔ∏è Developing an Extension

If you're familiar with React and/or TypeScript, you can write an extension yourself.

### Extension Use Cases

* Creating a UI for a world, character, or setting
* Making RPGs and other multimedia experiences
* Custom stat blocks that can do math and handle state correctly
* Specific input/output handling in code to deal with quirks of a particular model

### Why develop an extension instead of making something from scratch?

* **Intuitive Development:** The extensions framework and platform was created with developers in mind from the ground up, resulting in as straightforward an interface as possible with a negligible learning curve.&#x20;
* **Cross-platform:** Extensions are write once, run everywhere. When you commit, your extension is immediately built and available on the web, iOS and Android mobile devices, and the Vision Pro, with support for more platforms incoming.&#x20;
* **Multimedia:** Language, imagery, audio, and everything else can add up to a half-dozen or more APIs and interfaces that need to be set up, tested, monitored. With an extension, a unified interface for all of it is built in.
* **Audience Reach:** Many gaming and multimedia platforms ban GenAI content outright, or have userbases hostile to it. Chub has millions of people specifically here for generative AI.
* **Peace of Mind:** It has become a trope for passion projects using OpenAI and other APIs to get destroyed by hostiles reverse engineering it into a free proxy. If developed as an extension, it's not your problem, and you can focus on what matters.
* **Actively Developed Platform:** This is just the beginning. Scheduling, full VR/AR support, non-React implementations, and more are incoming.
